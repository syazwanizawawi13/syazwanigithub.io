          Since the late 1980s, more strict habitat protections have been put in place and stopped.
          However, their situation is still precarious. 
          Since their habitat is fragmented, they continue to be vulnerable 
          and famine when significant areas of the bamboo they depend finish and dies.

        body parts that are used in Asian "medicine." There are probably fewer than 4,000 in the wild today. 
        The consumption of endangered species, such as tigers, whose bones, penises, and other parts 
        are superstitiously thought to have miraculous healing properties, was formally banned in China in 2014</td>

        After three years, only 16  remained. Hunting and the shrinking of their marsh habitat 
        had depleted the population, and it wasn't until the late 1960s that coordinated attempts to save
         the remaining birds started. Today, there are more than 400 birds, largely because of creative 
         breeding methods.</td>

      subspecies, can be found in all of the world's oceans except the Arctic. Whaling in the twentieth 
      century is thought to have reduced the current population by up to 90%. Commercial hunting of the

    is between 40,000 and 50,000. That figure could be much lower; some areas inhabited by the lumbering 
    pachyderms are inaccessible due to terrain or political instability. India is home to more than half

      nearly drove them extinct. The species was nearly wiped out as a result of the commercial fur trade,
       with only 2,000 of an estimated 300,000 remaining by 1911. That same year, a global ban on commercial 
       hunting was enacted.</td>

  <td>Though it is called a leopard and certainly resembles a frosted version of those spotted residents of
     more equatorial regions, genetic analysis shows that the snow leopard is more closely related to the 
     tiger. There are probably fewer than 6,500 left in the wild, though data is difficult to come by due 
     to the species' preference for remote mountainous terrain and its elusive nature. China and Mongolia 
     have the largest populations, with significant populations in India and Kyrgyzstan as well.</td>

     or three subspecies, the eastern lowland, western lowland, and mountain gorillas, depending on who you ask.

  <td>"Orangutan" is Malaysian for "forest person." Though they look more like melted Muppets than people,
     their sophisticated cognitive abilities are very human. They, like gorillas and chimps, have been 
     observed using tools. According to a 2004 study, the number of orangutans on the Southeast Asian 
     islands of Borneo and Sumatra is less than 60,000, owing in large part to logging and capture for
      the exotic pet trade.</td>
