  <h3 style="font-size: 120%;"> Nur Syazwani Bt Mohamad Zawawi is a Malaysian student from UITM Rembau who founded the Save The Earth organisation website
  in the earlys 2022. “In the early 2021’s, I began to realize the developing trends of mankind were resulting in the poisoning of our earth.
   Late in 2021, my thoughts centered on motivating other people to help stop this destruction. My vision soon became focused on Save the Earth,
    “a message to help create a higher level of environmental consciousness among people.” Motivated by the awareness that the “Have a Nice Day” 
    smile face of the 60’s could bring a positive element into our daily lives, I knew that environmental artwork together with a meaningful message
     could become a positive influence on our earths future.</h3>

<h4 style="font-size: 120%;"> I was very excited about the positive affect of adding a colorful rainbow to our
   Save the Earth message. In 2017, after few years of working with “earth” art and the vital message of “Save The Earth,” 
   the funds to establish the environmental research foundation that I had always envisioned were finally available.  
   As people continue to embrace the “Save the Earth” message, we plan to continue funding vital research in an effort 
   to slow and ultimately reverse the deterioration of our planet earth. 
    
   <P>
    Today more than ever, we must
   acknowledge the fact that a great many environmental violations of the past continue to haunt us in 
   the present. Our support of research in the physical sciences will continue to find solutions to these 
   numerous man-made problems of the past and present.Moreover, we feel that our support of climate research
   and science centers will undoubtedly lead us to a better understanding of the connection between our
   behaviors and the environment, our goal is to pave the way towards a healthier future for our planet. Our mission is to make
   lasting changes by raising the environmental awareness of all people. Please join me in spreading the word. ”Save The Earth.” Time is running out.  Please share the message on your products if you’d like, and everyone please use it anywhere you see fit. The only thing I ask you not to do is copy the “Save The Earth” logo. Our logo identifies Save The Earth Foundation. Get creative and make your own “Save The Earth” logo. Thank you for spreading the word!”
